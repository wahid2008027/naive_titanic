# Naive Titanic Analysis

This repository contains a Jupyter Notebook for a basic analysis of the Titanic dataset. The analysis involves exploratory data analysis (EDA) and machine learning techniques to predict passenger survival.

## Project Overview
The Titanic dataset is one of the most famous datasets in machine learning and is often used for binary classification problems. This project applies a naive approach to predict survival based on available features.

## Files
- `naive-titanic.ipynb`: Jupyter Notebook containing the data analysis and model implementation.

## Requirements
To run the notebook, install the required dependencies:
```bash
pip install pandas numpy matplotlib seaborn scikit-learn
```

## Features and Methods
- Data Preprocessing
- Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
- Feature Engineering
- Machine Learning Model (Naive Approach)
- Model Evaluation

## Usage
1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/naive-titanic.git
   ```
2. Navigate to the project folder:
   ```bash
   cd naive-titanic
   ```
3. Open the Jupyter Notebook:
   ```bash
   jupyter notebook naive-titanic.ipynb
   ```
4. Run the cells to perform the analysis and make predictions.

## Results
The model provides a basic classification approach to predict survival. Further improvements can be made by fine-tuning hyperparameters, adding more features, and using advanced machine learning models.
